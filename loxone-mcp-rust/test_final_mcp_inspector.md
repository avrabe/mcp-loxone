# Final MCP Inspector Test

## Summary
Fixed the MCP backwards compatibility protocol implementation in the HTTP transport layer.

## The Problem
MCP Inspector was sending requests with `Accept: application/json` expecting immediate JSON responses (streamable HTTP transport), but our server was misinterpreting this and routing to the legacy SSE transport path. This caused:
- Server to return HTTP 204 No Content
- Responses sent via SSE channels that MCP Inspector wasn't listening to
- MCP Inspector showing "Connection Error" despite successful server operations

## The Fix
Updated the transport detection logic in `http.rs` to:
- Use `Accept: application/json` AND NOT `text/event-stream` for streamable HTTP
- Return JSON responses directly (HTTP 200) for streamable HTTP requests
- Use legacy SSE transport only when `Accept: text/event-stream` is present

## Test Results
✅ Streamable HTTP: Returns JSON directly (HTTP 200)
✅ Legacy SSE: Returns 204 No Content and sends via SSE

## Next Steps
1. Start the server: `cargo run --bin loxone-mcp-server -- http --port 3001`
2. Start MCP Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
3. Configure in browser:
   - Transport: `http`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3001/messages`
   - Headers: `X-API-Key: 1234`
4. Click Connect - should now work!

The backwards compatibility is now properly implemented according to the MCP specification.
