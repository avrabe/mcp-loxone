# Connection State Fix Summary

## Issue
The `control_all_rolladen` tool was failing with "Not connected to Miniserver" error for all devices, even though the server successfully loaded the structure and showed proper device counts.

## Root Cause
The HTTP client's `connected` field was never being set to `true` because the server initialization flow was not calling the `connect()` method on the client. The `send_command` method checks this field before sending any commands, causing all control operations to fail.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Server Initialization (src/server/mod.rs)
- Modified server initialization to call `client.connect()` after creating the client
- Added proper connection handling with fallback to basic auth if token auth fails
- Updated `new_with_client` helper to ensure clients are connected

### 2. Structure Loading Optimization
- Modified server to reuse the client's context if it already has the structure loaded (from `connect()`)
- Prevents duplicate structure loading for HTTP and Token HTTP clients
- Falls back to manual structure loading for other client types

## Changes Made

1. **Line 141**: Changed `let client = create_client(...)` to `let mut client = create_client(...)`
2. **Lines 143-199**: Added connection flow with `client.connect().await`
3. **Line 422**: Updated `new_with_client` to accept mutable client
4. **Lines 425-429**: Added connection check in `new_with_client`
5. **Lines 201-266**: Optimized structure loading to avoid duplication

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Start the server:
```bash
LOXONE_USERNAME=<user> LOXONE_PASSWORD=<pass> LOXONE_HOST=<host> \
cargo run --bin loxone-mcp-server http --port 3001
```

2. Run the test script:
```bash
python3 test_rolladen_control.py
```

## Expected Behavior

After the fix:
- Server connects to Loxone system during initialization
- The `connected` flag is properly set to `true`
- Device control commands work successfully
- The summary should show successful operations instead of all failures

## Verification

The fix is working if:
1. Server logs show "Successfully connected to Loxone system"
2. The `control_all_rolladen` response shows successful operations (not all failed)
3. Individual device control commands also work
