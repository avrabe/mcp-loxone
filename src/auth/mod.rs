//! Custom authentication module was removed in favor of PulseEngine MCP Framework v0.4.0
//! 
//! This module is now empty. All authentication functionality has been migrated
//! to use the framework authentication system.
//!
//! If you need authentication, please use `pulseengine_mcp_auth` directly.
